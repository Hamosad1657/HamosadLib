1.Build custom color sensor widget //https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/shuffleboard-widget-data-source-binding-tutorial-video/163128
2.Make a shuffleboard veiw for each class ( when needed)
3.Ask Shaked about what function to put in the CANCoder
4.Talk to Shaked about the PID
5.Talk to Shaked about the swerve
6. Add convertions to the encoder values.

1. HaMotorController will have basic motor controlling functions
	a. PID based control
	b. Abstract percent, current and voltage based control
	c. Abstarct mutual configuration settings
2. HaBaseTalon will implement the functions that are mutual to both talons
	a. Abstract mutual percent, current and voltage based control
	b. Abstract mutual talon functions
	c. Implement velocity and position based control
3. HaTalonFX and HaTalonSRX will implement their respective functions each
4. HaCANSparkMax will implement the functions of HaMotorController and it's own functions
	a. Implement percent, current and voltage base control
	b. Implement velocity and position based control
	c. Implement other functions
5. make HaMotorConfiguration class
	a. will have all the mutual configurations
	
* Everything will have these control methods: PID, percent, current, voltage, velocity, position,Raw (have enum for control type in HaUnits) 
* Everything will use the same velocity units: RPM, MPS, RadPS,Raw; And position units: Rad, Degrees (have enums for position and velocity types in HaUnits)


* Make constructors overload with the exiting Motor Object and one with the MotorObjectConfig ( both) 
* Make all motors public ( the original ones), and also add WheelRadius to all of them with the constructs and set thingies
* Make another configureallsettings function

* Make all objects sendable
* Make initShuffleboard for all of them ( with the lambda thingi sufi said, just ask him later cuz yes i forgot about it.)
